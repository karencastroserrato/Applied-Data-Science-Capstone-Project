# About this project

The purpose of this project is to simulate that you work for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, and in the process follow the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting your results to stakeholders.

The main task is to predict if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully.  SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. 

Therefore the idea is accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, in order to determine the cost of a launch. With the help of Data Science findings and models, the competing startup can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
